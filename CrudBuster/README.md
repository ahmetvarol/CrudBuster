# CrudBuster
An automatic CRUD endpoint generator for ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs that scans your project's entities and automatically generates corresponding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) service endpoints based on those entities, streamlining API development and reducing boilerplate code."

**CrudBuster**, allows you to quickly and flexibly generate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints in your ASP.NET Core applications. You can define your endpoints without relying on any interface by integrating your own service classes through delegates.

## Features
- **Automatic CRUD Endpoint Generation**: Create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints with a single method.
- **Flexible Service Integration**: Works with any service class thanks to its delegate-based structure.
- **Authorization Support**: You can add custom authorization policies to your endpoints.
- **Minimal API Support**: Optimized for .NET 6 and later.
- **Beta Release**: Currently in beta â€” we welcome your feedback!

```csharp
app.CrudBuster(opt => opt
    //!!! It must be the same as the method name in the repository.
    .WithGetByIdService("GetAsync")

    //!!! It must be the same as the method name in the repository.
    .WithGetListService("GetListAsync")

    //!!! It must be the same as the method name in the repository.
    .WithCreateService("CreateAsync")

    //!!! It must be the same as the method name in the repository.
    .WithUpdateService("UpdateAsync")

    //!!! It must be the same as the method name in the repository.
    .WithDeleteService("DeleteAsync")
    
    //It searches for entities in this layer.
    .WithDomainLayer("DOmain")
    
    //It searches for view models in this layer.
    .WithViewModelLayer("Application")
    
    //It searches for repo in this layer.
    .WithRepositoryLayer("Infrastructure")
    
    //In this field, you must assign the last part of the name you used in your view model classes. For example: ProductCreate*ViewModel*, ProductCreate*VM*, ProductCreate*DTO*, or whatever naming convention you follow.
    .WithViewModelPattern("VM")

    //You must provide your own view model path."
    .WithViewModelOutput(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()+"/ViewModels")
    
    // !!!The database tables must have the same name as the base entity class they inherit from.
    .WithBaseEntityName("IBaseEntity")
    
    //If required authenticate
